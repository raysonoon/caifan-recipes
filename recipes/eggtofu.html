            <li>1/2 tbsp sesame oil<li>
            <li>1 green onion, sliced (optional)</li>
            <li>cornstarch, to thicken</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat.</li> 
            <li>Add the egg tofu in a single layer and pan-fry the egg tofu on both sides until golden brown, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Move the egg tofu to a plate, then heat the other tablespoon of oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the ginger and onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent</li>
            <li>Add the shiitakes to the pan. Break up the enoki mushrooms into rough chunks with your hands, and add them to the pan as well with the garlic. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms look browned, slightly shrunken and dry.</li>
            <li>Add the sauces, water, sugar to the mushroom mixture. Mix well and braise for 5-8 min</li>
            <li>Add back the egg tofu and gently toss in the sauce, so as not to break up the egg tofu.</li>
            <li>Season with salt to taste and thicken with cornstarch solution.</li>
            <li>Turn heat to low and add beaten egg and sesame oil. Mix well</li>
            <li>Serve over rice and top with green onions.</li>
